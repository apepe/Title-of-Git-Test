For example, a single location (e.g., a living room) may be the site of many different experiences. The hippocampus is widely thought to play a critical role in coding overlapping events such that interference is minimized. Compelling evidence for this function comes from intracranial recordings in rodents during spatial navigation. For example, when rodents alternate between left- and right-hand turns in a T-maze, cells within the hippocampus differentially fire during the central stem (the overlapping path), according to whether the current route is a 'right-turn’ or 'left-turn’ route&nbsp;</i><a href="https://www.authorea.com/users/41248/articles/126663/_show_article#Wood_2000"><i>(Wood 2000,</i></a><i>&nbsp;</i><a href="https://www.authorea.com/users/41248/articles/126663/_show_article#Frank_2000"><i>Frank 2000)</i></a><i>.

No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful. Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example, which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, except to obtain some advantage from it? But who has any right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure that has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain that produces no resultant pleasure?</div>
